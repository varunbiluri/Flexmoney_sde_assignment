# Yoga Class Registration Web App

## Overview

This project is a comprehensive web application developed as part of an internship assignment at Flexmoney. The web app facilitates user registration for yoga classes, integrating a full MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. Throughout the development process, key aspects such as form validation, responsive design, frontend-backend connectivity, and online deployment were addressed.

## Project Highlights

### 1. Frontend Development

- Implemented an aesthetically pleasing admission form using HTML, CSS, and React.js.
- Ensured responsiveness to provide an optimal user experience across various devices.

### 2. Backend Development

- Developed the backend of the form utilizing Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.
- Implemented basic validations specified in the assignment requirements.

### 3. Form Validations

- Implemented the following basic validations:
  1. All input fields must be filled by the user.
  2. User name must not be empty.
  3. Age field must be between 18 and 65 years.
  4. Gender should be specified by the user.
  5. Contact number must consist of 10 digits.
  6. Fees should be exactly equal to 500.
  7. User must select a slot to proceed with the payment.

### 4. User Feedback

- Incorporated a "Payment Successful" message to inform users upon successful registration.

### 5. Future Enhancements

- The project has potential for real-world usage with the addition of a payment method, accepting payments via UPI or cards.
